In this Video we copy a Pod specification from the Kubernetes website,
make some changes to it and finally deploy our Container to a Kubernetes Cluster.

Once the Pod is running we learn about port-forwarding with kubectl and looking
and the logs of our Container. We won't need SSH for that anymore, yay!

Read the Kubernetes website to learn more about Pods:
